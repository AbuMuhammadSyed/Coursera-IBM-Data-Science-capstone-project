Also, we also needs to choose such a **location where there are no Hyderabadi restuarants nearby**. Furthermore, we also take care that the **prefer places/lactions should be as close as possible to the city center**, along with the first two criteria are met.\n\nWe will recommend the most suitable palces/neighborhoods based above mentioned criteria using the skills we learn during this long journey of Data Science Course. So stakeholders can choose best, suitable, possible area/location as we explain pros and cons each location in clear and easy way. "
